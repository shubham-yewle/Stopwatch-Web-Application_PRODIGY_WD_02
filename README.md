How It Works

* The **display** shows elapsed time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
* The **Start** button begins the timer using `setInterval()`.
* The **Pause** button stops the timer using `clearInterval()`.
* The **Reset** button clears the timer and lap history.
* The **Lap** button records the current time and displays it in a list.
* CSS media queries ensure proper layout and font sizing across devices.
